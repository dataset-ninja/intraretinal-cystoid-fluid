In the study of diversified ocular disorders where *cystoid macular edema* (CME) is implicated, the authors of the **Intraretinal Cystoid Fluid** dataset address the significant connection between these disorders and vision impairment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, used for retina examination, often contain artifacts like blurred edges and speckle noise. These artifacts pose challenges in accurately identifying retinal fluid. The authors employ various image preprocessing techniques, including minimum filtering, block-matching and 3D filtering, and the Richardsonâ€“Lucy deconvolution method, to reduce noise and other degradations in OCT scans while maintaining image quality assessment scores. These scores are determined using blind-less image spatial quality evaluation and sharpness estimation.

Furthermore, the authors introduce an automated deep learning (DL) method for detecting and quantifying retinal fluid, specifically CME, to assess its presence and progression. They utilize a U-net model with optimized hyperparameters to achieve optimal results. The improved DL method outperforms previously reported algorithms.

The authors emphasize the potential of combining ophthalmology and artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize diagnostic procedures for eye diseases, reduce human errors, and enhance clinical practices. They focus on diabetic macular edema (DME) and its association with cystoid macular edema (CME). They explain the stages of CME development in DME patients and how it can lead to macular holes of varying severity.

The core idea is to use DL algorithms, such as the U-net model, to analyze and predict results from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, reducing the chances of misdiagnosis. The automated method identifies and quantifies macular fluid in the retina and is compared to expert segmentations to assess its performance.

The authors describe their image preprocessing steps, including resizing, morphological operations, denoising, deconvolution, contrast adjustment, and feature scaling, to enhance OCT image quality and prepare them for DL analysis.

In terms of data collection, the authors obtained a dataset of retinal images primarily focused on DME patients, consisting of 1000 training images and 200 testing images. Manual binary image masking was performed to label pixels as foreground (CME) or background to train the DL model. This dataset was obtained from Kaggle and supplemented with images from the Institute of Ophthalmology.

The study's ultimate goal is to improve the diagnosis and understanding of CME in DME patients through the application of DL techniques to OCT images, thus reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and aiding medical professionals in their clinical practices.
