**Intraretinal Cystoid Fluid** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 1460 images with 6542 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cystic macular edema*).

Images in the Intraretinal Cystoid Fluid dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET), Pakistan and Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Pakistan.
