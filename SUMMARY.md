**Intraretinal Cystoid Fluid** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 1460 images with 6542 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (_cystic macular edema_).

Images in the Intraretinal Cystoid Fluid dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: _ds_ (1460 images). The dataset was released in 2022.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
